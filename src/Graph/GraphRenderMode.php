 * like — dot's own splines, arrowheads and fonts — while `Cells` draws node
 * labels as real terminal text, which stays readable at a pane size where the
 * bitmap's type is a few pixels tall. `Cells` is also what paints when dot
 * cannot render a bitmap at all (no libgd) or has not answered yet.
